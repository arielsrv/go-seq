**go-seq** (pronounced "go seek") is a Go package for working with *seq*uences.

Go 1.23 introduced [iterators](https://go.dev/doc/go1.23#iterators) and the [`iter.Seq`](https://pkg.go.dev/iter#Seq) and [`iter.Seq2`](https://pkg.go.dev/iter#Seq) sequence types. This package provides functions to transform, filter, collect, and reduce sequences.
